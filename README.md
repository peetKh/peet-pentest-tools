This repo contains some tools and code templates I use for labs and CTFs to
make my life a bit easier.


# chonker #

Chonker is a reverse shell listener providing a prompt with editing capabilities
and history based command completion. It basically is a python
implementation of `rlwrap nc -nlvp` that I wrote it before I knew about rlwrap, but my ASCII chonker is cute !


# code-templates #

## http ##

### requests-ALL.py ###

Code template for most common usages of requests
Includes: cookies, old SSL/TLSv1 (see below), send files, multipart, tokens.

### requests-old-https.py ###

A code template to build a Requests.Session object to connect to HTTPS server
using old deprecated TLS versions, that modern browsers and APIs usually refuse
to connect to. It is, by construction, insecure!

### webshell-client.py ###

A very simple webshell client template to make use of webshell more
confortable. Once properly configured it provides a prompt with completion from
history and takes care of all processing (URL encoding, sending request and
parsing the response)
