This repo contains some tools and code templates I use for labs and CTFs to
make my life a bit easier.


# chonker #

Chonker is a reverse shell listener providing a prompt with editing capabilities
and history based command completion. It basically is a python
implementation of `rlwrap nc -nlvp` that I wrote before I knew about rlwrap,
but my ASCII-art chonker is cute !

# minisocks #

Minisocks is a minimalistic SOCKS 4 and SOCKS 5 proxy server I wrote to use
for pivoting through Windows machines. It automatically detects the SOCKS version,
so you don't have to worry about it, but it only implements the CONNECT
command with IPv4 addresses (no DNS resolution), and the no authentication for
SOCKS 5. 

The point of this program is to provide dynamic port forwarding with a standalone 
file that requires no runtime library or installation. Just upload it and run it.

# code-templates #

## http ##

### requests-ALL.py ###

Code template for most common usages of requests
Includes: cookies, old SSL/TLSv1 (see below), send files, multipart, tokens.

### requests-old-https.py ###

A code template to build a Requests.Session object to connect to HTTPS server
using old deprecated TLS versions, that modern browsers and APIs usually refuse
to connect to. It is, by construction, insecure!

### webshell-client.py ###

A very simple webshell client template to make use of webshell more
confortable. Once properly configured it provides a prompt with completion from
history and takes care of all processing (URL encoding, sending request and
parsing the response)
